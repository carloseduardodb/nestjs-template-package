# Template for Creating NestJS Libraries

This repository provides a basic template for creating new libraries in the NestJS framework. Using this template streamlines the initial setup process and offers an organized structure for developing reusable libraries.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed in your development environment:

Node.js (version 16.14.0 or higher)
NPM (Node.js package manager): 8.3.1
Installation

1 - Clone this repository to your local development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carloseduardodb/nestjs-template-package.git
```

2 - Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nestjs-template-package/consumer
cd nestjs-template-package/lib
```

3 - Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4 - Remember to build the lib folder for use in the consumer

# Usage

This template provides a basic folder structure for developing libraries in NestJS. Follow the steps below to get started:

1 - Edit the package.json file to provide relevant information about your library, such as name, description, version, author, license, etc.

2 - In the src directory, you will find the basic folder structure for your library. Feel free to add, remove, or modify files as needed for your specific use case.

3 - Implement the logic and features of your library in the corresponding files.

4 - Run unit tests to ensure the proper functioning of your library:

```bash
npm test
```

5 - Once you have finished developing your library, build it to generate the executable JavaScript code:

```bash
npm run build
```

Your compiled library will be available in the dist directory. You can now package and publish it to an npm package registry or use it locally in other projects.
